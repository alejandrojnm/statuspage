# Statuspage
> Self hosted status page written in golang!

![Dashboard](screenshot.png?raw=true "Dashboard")

This is a small status page project with Postgres as the backing datastore.
There should be no need to change the go code to customize the page.
We use environment variables for configuration, this also includes the logo.

## Todo

* API authorization
* Incident API
* Customize page with env variables
